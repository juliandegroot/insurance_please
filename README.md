The internet is becoming ever more prevalent in people's lives. However, it is not just cyber activity which is growing, but also cyber crime. In spite of this growing danger, many people are not aware of the actual dangers they are facing nor how to avoid or prevent it. For this reason we have chosen to design a game to help address this issue and raise awareness to the dangers of an online world and the cybercrime that occurs in there.
The target audience for this game is insurance workers. However, it can also be used to teach the dangers of cybercrime to company/office workers in general.
